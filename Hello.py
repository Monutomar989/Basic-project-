#Lets start.....

print("Hello Everyone")

# let suppose we have 2 variable these are given below

a=int(input("Enter your First Value: "))
b=int(input("Enter your Second Value: "))

# # these 2 variable are dynamic which are depend on directly you thinking what you put here
#
# # so we start form mathematics rule
# # 1. is addition
# print("addition")
# print(a+b)
# # 2. in subtraction
# print("subtraction")
# print(a-b)
# # 3. is multiplication
# print("multiplication")
# print(a*b)
# # 4. is dividation(1)
# print("dividation(1)")
# print(a/b)
# #  this dividation rule give floot value
# # 5. dividation (2)
# print("dividation (2)")
# print(a//b)
# # this rule give me int value
# # 6. is Modules
# print("modules")
# print(a%b)
