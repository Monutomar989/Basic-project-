#  Lets we start Types of operator
#  1. Relation Operator
# > -> greater than
# < -> less than
# == -> equal to
# ! -> not equal to

#  for example

# # -> Greater then
# a=int(input("Enter your First Number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter your second number: "))
# if a>b:
#     print("A is Greater then B")
# else:
#     print("B is Greater then A")
#
# #  -> Less Then
# a=int(input("Enter your First Number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter your second number: "))
# if a<b:
#     print("A is less then B")
# else:
#     print("B is less then A")
#
# # -> Equal to
# a=int(input("Enter your First Number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter your second number: "))
# if a==b:
#     print("A is equal to B")
# else:
#     print("A does not equal to B")

# -> not equal to
a=int(input("Enter your First Number: "))
b=int(input("Enter your second number: "))
if a!=b:
    print("ohh no these are not same")
else:
    print("ohh shit these are really same")
